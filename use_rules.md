This project is an experiment in creating tools for the implementation and use of coral-app-s6ege.ondigitalocean.app platform, so we do not bear any responsibility in case of interruptions in work, loss of clients, money, time or nerves. We also undertake not to transfer your data to third parties other than coral-app-s6ege.ondigitalocean.app and ai-m.io, however, we cannot guarantee the safety of any data; in case of incorrect configuration of the tool, you are responsible yourself.
